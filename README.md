# Algorithms ProblemSets
This file contains all the problem sets I've done for both Algorithms I (weeks 1-5) and algorithms II (weeks 1, 3-4). Any notes below will be specified in the specific section.

### Algorithms I
Throughout the course I bounced back and forth from too many to too little comments, so there may be some projects where I wrote too much and others where I wrote too little. Also for Week 1, there are 2 files because I completed percolation without knowledge of bitwise arithmetic and then did the problem again when 
I was given a hint to learn about it. Looking back there are definately places I could've optimized my code, but this was also done partially for readability. For reference if anyone is using this to see where they made a mistake after multiple submissions and attempts all of my projects recived 100% or higher except for 
Perc_w_Backwash (my first attempt at percolation). All of the links to the rubric for the problems can be found at the below links:

- <a href="https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues/specification.php"> Week 2 - queues </a>
- <a href="https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/collinear/specification.php"> Week 3 - collinear </a>
- <a href="https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/8puzzle/specification.php"> Week 3 - 8puzzle </a>
- <a href="https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/kdtree/specification.php"> Week 5 - kdtrees </a> (I liked this one the most because I love recursion ðŸ˜„)

### Algorithms II
Coming Soon 

### Final Note
Feel free to comment questions if you need help understanding/want me to add more comments and I'll update the files and I hope this is helpful!
